#Theory:
#1. Strings
#A string can be read from the standard input using the function input() or defined
#in single or double quotes. Two strings can be concatenated, and we can also repeat
#a string n times multiplying it by integer:
print('>_< ' * 5)  # >_< >_< >_< >_< >_<

#A string in Python is a sequence of characters. The function len(some_string)
#returns how many characters there are in a string:
print(len('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'))  # 26

#Every object in Python can be converted to string using the function str(some_object).
#So we can convert numbers to strings:
s = str(2 ** 100)
print(s)  # 1267650600228229401496703205376
print(len(s))  # 31

# 2. Slices: single character
# A slice gives from the given string one character or some fragment: substring or subsequence.
# There are three forms of slices. The simplest form of the slice: a single character
#slice S[i] gives ith character of the string. We count characters starting from 0.
#That is, if S = 'Hello', S[0] == 'H', S[1] == 'e', S[2] == 'l', S[3] == 'l', S[4] == 'o'.
#Note that in Python there is no separate type for characters of the string.
#S[i] also has the type str, just as the source string.
# Number i in S[i] is called an index.
# If you specify a negative index, then it is counted from the end, starting with
#the number -1. That is, S[-1] == 'o', S[-2] == 'l', S[-3] == 'l', S[-4] == 'e', S[-5] == 'H'.
# Let's summarize it in the table:
(String S): 	H 	  e 	 l 	     l 	     o
Index: 	      S[0] 	 S[1]   S[2] 	S[3] 	S[4]
Index: 	     S[-5] 	 S[-4] 	S[-3] 	S[-2] 	S[-1]

# 3. Slices: substring
# Slice with two parameters S[a:b] returns the substring of length b - a, starting
# with the character at index a and lasting until the character at index b, not including
# the last one. For example, S[1:4] == 'ell', and you can get the same substring using S[-4:-1].
# You can mix positive and negative indexes in the same slice, for example, S[1:-1] is a
# substring without the first and the last character of the string (the slice begins with the
# character with index 1 and ends with an index of -1, not including it).
#
# Slices with two parameters never cause IndexError. For example, for S == 'Hello' the
# slice S[1:5] returns the string 'ello', and the result is the same even if the second index
# is very large, like S[1:100].
#
# If you omit the second parameter (but preserve the colon), then the slice goes to the end
# of string. For example, to remove the first character from the string (its index is 0) take
# the slice S[1:]. Similarly if you omit the first parameter, then Python takes the slice from
# the beginning of the string. That is, to remove the last character from the string, you can
# use slice S[:-1]. The slice S[:] matches the string S itself.

# 4. Slices: immutability of strings
# Any slice of a string creates a new string and never modifies the original one. In Python
# strings are immutable, i.e they can not be changed as the objects. You can only assign the
# variable to the new string, but the old one stays in memory.
# In fact in Python there is no variables. There are only the names that are associated with
# any objects. You can first associate a name with one object, and then â€” with another. Can
# several names be associated with one and the same object.
# Let's demonstrate that:

s = 'Hello'
t = s  # s and t point to the same string
t = s[2:4]  # now t points to the new string 'll'
print(s)  # prints 'Hello' as s is not changed
print(t)  # prints 'll'

# 5. Slices: subsequence
# If you specify a slice with three parameters S[a:b:d], the third parameter specifies
# the step, same as for function range(). In this case only the characters with the following
# index are taken: a a + d, a + 2 * d and so on, until and not including the character with
# index b. If the third parameter equals to 2, the slice takes every second character, and
# if the step of the slice equals to -1, the characters go in reverse order. For example,
# you can reverse a string like this: S[::-1]. Let's see the examples:
# e.g.:
s = 'abcdefg'
print(s[1]) # b
print(s[-1]) # g
print(s[1:3]) # bc
print(s[1:-1]) # bcdef
print(s[:3]) # abc
print(s[2:]) #cdefg
print(s[:-1]) #abcdef
print(s[::2]) #aceg
print(s[1::2]) #bdf
print(s[::-1]) #gfedcba

#eg 2:
s = 'abcdefghijklm'
print(s[0:10:2]) #acegi # note how 0 is starting point, 10 is end of string(non inclus) and 2 is step
#eg 3
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i, s[i])
#output:
#0 a
#2 c
#4 e
#6 g
#8 i

# 6. String methods: find() and rfind()
# A method is a function that is bound to the object. When the method is called, the method
# is applied to the object and does some computations related to it. Methods are invoked as
# object_name.method_name(arguments). For example, in s.find("e")  the string method find()
# is applied to the string s with one argument "e".
#
# Method find() searches a substring, passed as an argument, inside the string on which it's
# called. The function returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the
# substring is not found, the method returns -1.

#eg1:
s = 'Hello'
print(s.find('e')) # 1 - returns index where it's found (start if multiple letters)
print(s.find('ll')) # 2
print(s.find('L')) # -1 # this is returned when string not found. -1 = not found!

#Similarly, the method rfind() returns the index of the last occurrence of the substring.
#eg 2:
s = 'abracadabra'
print(s.find('b') # 1
print(s.rfind('b')) # 8

# If you call find() with three arguments s.find(substring, left, right), the search
# is performed inside the slice s[left:right]. If you specify only two arguments,
# like s.find(substring, left), the search is performed in the slice s[left:], that is,
# starting with the character at index left to the end of the string.
# Method s.find(substring, left, right) returns the absolute index, relatively to the
# whole string s, and not to the slice.
s = 'my name is bond, james bond, okay?'
print(s.find('bond')) # 11
print(s.find('bond', 12)) # 23

# 7. String methods: replace()
# Method replace() replaces all occurrences of a given substring with another one.
# Syntax: s.replace(old, new)  takes the string S and replaces all occurrences of
# substring old with the substring new.
# eg:
print('a bar is a bar, essentially'.replace('bar', 'pub')) # 'a pub is a pub, essentially'

# One can pass the third argument count, like this: s.replace(old, new, count). It
# makes replace() to replace only first count occurrences and then stop.
# e.g.:
print('a bar is a bar, essentially'.replace('bar', 'pub', 1)) # 'a pub is a bar, essentially'

# 8. String methods: count()
# This method counts the number of occurrences of one string within another string.
# The simplest form is this one: s.count(substring). Only non-overlapping occurrences
# are taken into account:
# e.g.
print('Abracadabra'.count('a')) # 4
print(('aaaaaaaaaa').count('aa')) # 5

# If you specify three parameters s.count(substring, left, right), the count is
# performed within the slice s[left:right].
